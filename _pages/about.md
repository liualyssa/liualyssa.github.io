# About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at NYU Stern School of Business. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mor Armony](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/mor-armony) (NYU Stern), [Jing Dong](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/jing-dong) (Columbia Business School), and [Rouba Ibrahim](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/people/roubaibrahim) (UCL School of Management).

My research broadly focuses on problems in healthcare operations, where I combine methods from stochastic modeling, econometrics, and machine learning to develop empirically grounded models that yield operational insights into healthcare systems. Drawing on real-world collaborations with leading hospitals, my work seeks to improve both efficiency and fairness in patient care delivery. At the core of my work is a commitment to rigorous analysis and practical impact, with an interdisciplinary perspective and a long-term vision for designing implementable, effective, and equitable solutions to complex operations challenges.
